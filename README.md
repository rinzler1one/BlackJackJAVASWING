# BlackJackJAVASWING
A GUI desktop game written in Java. Designed GUI using Java Swing

My first desktop game written in Java and my first attempt at implementing the MVVM architecture. The resources folder contains all the images used in this game such as the cards and the dealer image. In the Deck.java file, in the constructor, there is a linked hashmap field called cardsToImageIconsLinkedHashMap field which maps the numbers (which represents individual cards in the deck) to the card images in the resources folder. For the app to run you need to reference the correct directory that contains those images in your computer. In the GameView.java, the stayButton() method also references the directory that contains the card images. You need to reference the correct directory in that java file as well.
