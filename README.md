# BlackJackJAVASWING
A GUI desktop game written in Java. Designed GUI using Java Swing

My first desktop game written in Java and my first attempt at implementing the MVVM architecture. The resources folder contains all the images used in this game such as the cards and the dealer image. 

UPDATE: I updated the reference to the images used in the game so that it would work on anyone's computer as long as you have the images folder in the same place as the .java files.
